# UR-robot-scripting-and-offline-programming-in-a-virtual-reality-environment
Sometimes simulation and robot offline programming can be difficult and tedious. Furthermore, many programming interfaces are not very intuitive for the user, which makes the robot programming difficult. In addition, programming and testing directly in the physical robot may be dangerous for the online robot programmers (when working with classical industrial arms) and for the robot itself. Unexpected collisions, reachability problems, singularity positions and other derived problems could be handled in an easy manner in early stages of the development within a safe, virtual environment. Furthermore, physical robot availability might be a limitation for operator training and for programming testing.
